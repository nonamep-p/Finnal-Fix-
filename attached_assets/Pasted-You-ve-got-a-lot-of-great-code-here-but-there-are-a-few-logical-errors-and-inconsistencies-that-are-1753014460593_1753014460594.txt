You've got a lot of great code here, but there are a few logical errors and inconsistencies that are likely causing problems or will cause them down the line. Here's a breakdown of the issues and how to fix them.

1. The create_default_player_data function is flawed
Your create_default_player_data function has several issues that will prevent it from working as intended:

It tries to access a variable PLAYER_CLASSES that doesn't exist within its scope.

The logic for applying class stats is incorrect; it accesses 'hp', 'mana', and 'stamina' from the 'base_stats' dictionary, but those values are at the top level of each class's data.

The function returns a dictionary with hardcoded items like 'cheese_knife', but your ITEMS import from rpg_data/game_data is unused. This will make it hard to manage items later.

Solution:

Here is a corrected version of the create_default_player_data function. This version correctly uses the CHARACTER_CLASSES dictionary defined at the top of your file and properly applies the base stats and resources.

Python

def create_default_player_data(user_id: str, username: str, player_class: str = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Creates a new default player data structure.
    Applies base stats and initial equipment based on selected class.
    """
    # Default values for a character before class selection
    base_stats = {
        "strength": 10, "dexterity": 10, "constitution": 10,
        "intelligence": 10, "wisdom": 10, "charisma": 10
    }
    base_hp = 100
    base_mana = 50
    base_stamina = 100

    # Apply class-specific data if a class is provided
    if player_class and player_class in CHARACTER_CLASSES:
        class_data = CHARACTER_CLASSES[player_class]
        # Use the class's base stats directly
        base_stats = class_data['base_stats'].copy() # Use .copy() to avoid modifying the original dict
        base_hp = class_data['base_hp']
        base_mana = class_data['base_mana']
        base_stamina = class_data['base_stamina']

    # The rest of your function remains the same...
    return {
        'user_id': user_id,
        'username': username,
        'hp': base_hp,
        'max_hp': base_hp,
        'mana': base_mana,
        'max_mana': base_mana,
        'stamina': base_stamina,
        'max_stamina': base_stamina,
        'xp': 0,
        'level': 1,
        'gold': 100,
        'player_class': player_class,
        'stats': base_stats,
        'inventory': {'health_potion': 2, 'cheese_knife': 1},
        'equipped_items': {
            'weapon': 'cheese_knife',
            'helmet': None,
            'chestplate': None,
            'leggings': None,
            'boots': None,
            'accessory': None
        },
        'quests': { 'active': [], 'completed': [] },
        'current_dungeon': None,
        'dungeon_floor': 0,
        'combat_state': {
            'in_combat': False, 'enemy_hp': 0, 'enemy_max_hp': 0,
            'enemy_name': None, 'turn_order': [], 'current_turn': 0, 'message_id': None
        },
        'status_effects': {},
        'creation_date': datetime.now().isoformat(),
        'last_active': datetime.now().isoformat(),
        'achievements': [],
        'cooldowns': {
            'adventure': 0, 'work': 0, 'daily': 0, 'battle': 0, 'skill_cooldowns': {}
        },
        'prestige_level': 0,
        'legacy_modifiers': [],
        'luck_points': 0
    }
2. Redundant start commands
You have defined the start command three different times:

commands.command(name='start')

app_commands.command(name="start")

A start_adventure function that is never actually registered as a command.

This will cause conflicts and confusion. Since you're building a modern bot, you should stick to slash commands (app_commands). The old prefix commands (commands.command) are outdated.

Solution:

Delete the start_adventure and start_slash functions entirely. Modify the ClassSelectionView and your primary start command to handle everything cleanly. Here is a streamlined start command and ClassSelectionView that work together correctly:

Python

class ClassSelectionView(discord.ui.View):
    def __init__(self, author: discord.User):
        super().__init__(timeout=300)
        self.author = author

        # Create dropdown for class selection
        options = []
        for class_key, class_data in CHARACTER_CLASSES.items():
            if not class_data.get("locked", False):
                options.append(discord.SelectOption(
                    label=class_data["name"],
                    value=class_key,
                    description=class_data["description"][:100],
                    emoji=class_data["emoji"]
                ))

        # Define the select menu's callback directly
        @discord.ui.select(placeholder="Choose your class...", options=options)
        async def class_select(interaction: discord.Interaction, select: discord.ui.Select):
            if interaction.user.id != self.author.id:
                await interaction.response.send_message("This is not for you!", ephemeral=True)
                return

            selected_class = select.values[0]
            player_data = create_default_player_data(str(self.author.id), self.author.display_name, selected_class)
            
            if save_player_data(player_data):
                class_data = CHARACTER_CLASSES[selected_class]
                embed = discord.Embed(
                    title="üéâ Character Created!",
                    description=f"Welcome, **{self.author.display_name}**! You are now a {class_data['emoji']} **{class_data['name']}**.\nUse `/profile` to see your character sheet.",
                    color=0x2ECC71 # Example success color
                )
                await interaction.response.edit_message(embed=embed, view=None)
            else:
                await interaction.response.edit_message(content="‚ùå Error: Could not save your character. Please try again.", embed=None, view=None)

        self.add_item(class_select)


class RPGGamesCog(commands.Cog):
    def __init__(self, bot):
        self.bot = bot

    @app_commands.command(name="start", description="Start your RPG adventure and create your character.")
    async def start(self, interaction: discord.Interaction):
        # Your module check can go here if needed
        # if not is_module_enabled("rpg", interaction.guild.id):
        #     return await interaction.response.send_message("RPG is disabled here.", ephemeral=True)

        if load_player_data(str(interaction.user.id)):
            await interaction.response.send_message("You already have a character! Use `/profile` to see it.", ephemeral=True)
            return

        embed = discord.Embed(
            title="üåü Welcome to Plagg's RPG Adventure!",
            description="Choose your class below to begin your journey!",
            color=0x3498DB # Example primary color
        )
        view = ClassSelectionView(interaction.user)
        await interaction.response.send_message(embed=embed, view=view, ephemeral=True)

    # ... your other commands like /profile would go here, also as app_commands ...
3. Inconsistent Data Handling in reset_character
Your reset_character command saves an almost empty dictionary to the database: save_player_data({'user_id': user_id, 'username': ...}). This will likely cause errors later when other commands try to access keys like 'level' or 'stats' that no longer exist.

Solution:

Instead of saving a new, malformed dictionary, you should simply delete the player's key from the database. This is a much cleaner way to "reset" a character.

Python

# Inside your reset_character command, after the user confirms...
if response.content.lower() == 'confirm':
    # This is the line to change
    try:
        del db[f"rpg_player_{user_id}"]
        embed = create_embed(
            "‚úÖ Character Reset",
            "Your character has been deleted! Use `/start` to create a new one.",
            COLORS['success']
        )
        await ctx.send(embed=embed)
    except KeyError:
        # This handles the unlikely case where the data was deleted between the check and now
        embed = create_embed(
            "‚ùå Error",
            "Could not find your character data to delete.",
            COLORS['error']
        )
        await ctx.send(embed=embed)
By making these changes, your code will be more robust, modern, and less prone to errors. You'll have a solid foundation for building out the rest of your RPG features.
