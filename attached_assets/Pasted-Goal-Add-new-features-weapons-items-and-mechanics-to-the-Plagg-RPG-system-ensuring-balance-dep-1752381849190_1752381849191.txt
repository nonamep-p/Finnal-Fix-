Goal: Add new features, weapons, items, and mechanics to the Plagg RPG system, ensuring balance, depth, and player engagement through unique unlock conditions, class-specific roles, and epic rewards.

Structure:

    Class-Specific Weapons and Items
        Define weapons, armor, and consumables for each class (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Archer, Healer).
        Include attack, defense, and effects for each item.
        Assign rarity tiers (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythic) and balance stats accordingly.

    Special/Unique Weapons (Class-Unlocked or Event-Only)
        Introduce limited-time or event-only weapons with unique mechanics.
        Create a hidden class (e.g., Chrono Weave) with exclusive weapons and abilities.
        Design mythic weapons that require unusual or challenging achievements to obtain.

    Weapon Obtainment Conditions
        Set specific, story-driven conditions for acquiring rare weapons (e.g., defeating bosses at low levels, completing quests, or navigating dungeons).
        Ensure balance by linking weapon power to difficulty and rarity.

    Rarity System
        Define stats, drop rates, and effects for each rarity tier.
        Ensure high-tier weapons are powerful but require significant effort to earn.

    Balance and Mechanics
        Avoid overpowered weapons by adding trade-offs (e.g., high attack = low defense).
        Ensure class diversity by making each weapon role-specific.
        Include randomized effects (e.g., a “Paradox Core” that boosts a random stat).

*Note: Mythic weapons have custom mechanics (e.g., "Shatter the Void" or "Cursed Luck").
5. Balance and Mechanics

    No overpowered weapons: Each has trade-offs (e.g., high attack = low defense).
    Class diversity: Weapons are role-specific (e.g., Warriors focus on defense, Mages on spellpower).
    Randomized effects: Use dice rolls or randomizers for items like the Paradox Core.
    Unusual conditions: Ensure high-tier weapons require story-driven achievements.

Final Notes for Implementation:

    Use clear commands (e.g., $get_weapon, $unlock_class) to manage weapon acquisition.
    Add narrative prompts (e.g., "A whisper in the void warns: 'You are the final time traveler.'").
    Test balance by simulating player progression and combat scenarios.
